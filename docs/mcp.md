# MCP server

Typed tools over the client: `freeagent_get` and `find_contacts` (read-only), `create_contact`, `create_timeslip`, `create_draft_invoice` (always Draft, emails off), `create_expense` (optional local receipt file), `create_bill` (supplier bill with line items and optional attachment), `create_draft_estimate` (always Draft, never sent), `create_project`, `create_task`, `explain_bank_transaction` (one explanation per call). Writes read back and return what FreeAgent holds.

The Claude Code and Codex plugins start it with `uvx` straight from GitHub (see `.mcp.json`), so no checkout or pip install is needed; `uv` must be installed. Run `freeagent-ai login` once first (e.g. `uvx --from git+https://github.com/avalou-co/freeagent-ai freeagent-ai login`); the server uses the same credentials file.

For local development: `pip install -e '.[mcp]'` and `freeagent-ai mcp`.

## ChatGPT / remote HTTP

ChatGPT connects to remote servers only, so it needs `freeagent-ai mcp --http` (serves `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`) reachable over public HTTPS, added as a custom connector in developer mode.

**HTTP mode requires a bearer token and fails closed.** Set `FREEAGENT_MCP_TOKEN` to a random secret of at least 32 ASCII characters before starting; without it the server refuses to start. Every request must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; others get `401` before any FreeAgent call. stdio mode needs no token.

```sh
export FREEAGENT_MCP_TOKEN="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
freeagent-ai mcp --http
```

Secure remote setup:

- Keep the default `--host 127.0.0.1` and expose it only through an HTTPS tunnel or reverse proxy. The token is sent in a header, so never serve it over plain HTTP across a network.
- Treat the token like a password: keep it out of shell history, repos and logs, and rotate it (restart with a new value) if it may have leaked. Anyone holding it can read and write your FreeAgent account.
- The connector client must be able to send a custom `Authorization: Bearer` header. If it cannot, do not use remote mode.
- This is a single static shared secret, not OAuth. Get an independent security review before relying on it for remote use.
